Automation in day-to-day work - What is needed

5th February 2022

Enabling documents

Machine-readable. 

Wikipedia defines a machine-readable document as a “document whose content can be readily processed by computers. Such documents are distinguished from machine-readable data by virtue of having sufficient structure to provide the necessary context to support the business processes for which they are created.”
Structured content. 

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a “programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods)”. For such programming to readily process content, the content itself needs to take up the same structure for worldly entities and related aspects, in a set up suitable for automation with code modules.

Established format. 

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) “is an open standard file format and data interchange format that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects consisting of attribute–value pairs and arrays.”

State of the Art interactions

The basic interaction is the conversion of JSON into code objects; selection of names directs a universal assembler to handle large volumes of data  to assemble workpieces. Such automation allows this to happen on a small screen. Output is automatically sent to cloud storage. Further interactions include:
Selection from lexicons to minimise input to avoid duplication and improve accuracy, connectivity and productivity
Search  - new deductive processes that generate multimedia to visualise and test different combinations of entities, aspects and devices
Advertising - mutually beneficial collaboration between buyers and sellers

The World Wide Web grew out of a need for better interactions in scientific research, in particular, its papers. For the general public, interactions relate back to the real world, in particular, the built environment. Names used to identify its entities, from cities to screws if you like, provide both the means to identify and navigate its complexity, and the means to automate aspects that make them part of work processes, and by default, part of infrastructure. 

Those who would benefit from automation in the creation of the built environment would make ideal sponsors. This paper is part of the search to find at least one.
